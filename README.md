# **Vet App** üêæ

This is an veterinary platform which will allow to manage the clients, locations and facilities.

## Environment Variables 

First, you need to set up the whole variables in order to connect the database and the API works correctly.

Once you clone the repository, create a `.env` file, and set the following variables:

```json
PORT=XXXX
DB_USERNAME=XXXXXX
DB_PASSWORD=XXXXXXX
DB_NAME=vet-app
JWT_SECRET=XXXXX
MAILSOURCE = XXXXXXXXX@mail.com
PASSWORD_MAIL =  XXXXXXXX
```

On the other hand, you will need to start the server and the API will begins to work and can being used. So, do `npm run dev` if you're in developtment environment, bt if you're in production, you have to run:  `npm run start`.

Thanks !
